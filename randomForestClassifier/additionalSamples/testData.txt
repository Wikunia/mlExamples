Well Mr Abrams sure succeeded on this one, walked in slightly skeptical cause of how disappointing the first two prequels in particular were. But man did I get blown away! It felt like Star Wars, you could see the attention to detail and the lack of CGI for the sake of CGI, the old cast were stellar and the new cast were really really good too as the new main characters. Never looked at the time once and never took my eyes of the beautiful worlds we were shown. Really gave me that feeling of exploring that galaxy far away again that I got back when I were a kid.

And to those complaining about similarities to episode IV I just have this to say: What do you call episode VI then? "return to death star"? It does not have to be 100% original to still be a great movie, barely nothing is original anymore.
